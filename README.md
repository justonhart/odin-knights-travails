# Odin Binary Search Trees

This project is part of the Odin Project, a self-driven web development training program. Learn more at [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/).

## Project summary

The assignment for this project was to implement code to determine the shortest path for a Knight to reach a designated space using JavaScript. I prefer TypeScript so I used that instead. I used Jest to test my implementation.

### Thoughts

This project was a bit of a challenge; I leaned on the linked resources (Khan Academy, namely) more than I initially thought I would have to. That said, all of the test cases outlined in the project prompt pass and I'm confident that this works correctly.
